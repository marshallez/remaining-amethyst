1. Starts out unknown, once an amethyst ore is mined it will then detect how many ores are remaining in each amethyst rock mined.
2. Automatically detects if expert mining gloves are worn and shows the number accordingly.
3. The outline colors and blend are configurable.
4. Varrock armor, gem bag, etc. will not cause issues.

### Bugs
1. Likely buggy if someone is mining the same amethyst that you are.
2. Removing and/or equipping mining gloves will not immediately take effect on the remaining number of ores. They must be worn when the last amethyst you mined despawned.
